ShinyCocos license:
---------------------------

Following the same idea than Cocos2D for iPhone, ShinyCocos was originally
licensed under the GNU LGPL v3 license.
But since it is impossible to distribute 3rd party dynamic libraries
for the iPhone, this license extends the GNU LGPL v3 license by allowing you: 
  a) to use ShinyCocos as a static library
  b) to include all or part of the ShinyCocos sources inside your project

This means that if you do a) and/or b) you are NOT forced to release your 
source code under the GNU LGPL v3 license.

What is an improvement to the library and what's part of your game is
decided by the your own good faith.

Remember that ShinyCocos follows the copyleft idea. So if you think that
you're improving the library, share your changes with the community with this same
license.

If you have any doubt regarding the license, please contact Rolando Abarca.
