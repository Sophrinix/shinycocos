# ShinyCocos

## About

ShinyCocos is a ruby bindings for the Cocos2D-iphone game framework

## Requirements

There are only install requirements:

* svn
* curl (installed with Mac OS X)

## Installation

First, run the script that will fetch ruby and cocos2d-iphone:

    > ./get_dependencies.rb

or:

    > ruby get_dependencies.rb

Open the cocos2d-iphone project and set the output directory to
"../build" instead of "build".

Open the TestShinyCocos and build.

Now you're ready to rock :-)

## TODO

* Add documentation :-)
* Integrate the rest of the cocos2d-iphone API
* Benchmarks
