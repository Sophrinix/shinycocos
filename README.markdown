# ShinyCocos

## About

ShinyCocos is a ruby bindings for the Cocos2D-iphone game framework

## Requirements

There are only install requirements:

* svn
* curl (installed with Mac OS X)
* rubyosa gem (install with `sudo gem install rubyosa`)

## Installation

First, run the script that will fetch ruby and cocos2d-iphone:

    > ./get_dependencies.rb

or:

    > ruby get_dependencies.rb

Now you're ready to rock :-)
If you want, you can take the TestShinyCocos project and start from
there.

## TODO

* Add documentation :-)
* Benchmarks
